# Weather React App

This app is created using ReactJS. It used the implimentation of the OpenWeather API to fetch data to then render out

## OpenWeather--

'https://openweathermap.org/' 

There are small bugs since the API is fetched in Celcius compared to the Fahrenheit


Future
=========
- add a converter from celcius to fahrenheit
- sound
- animation
- more user interactions to compare etc.
